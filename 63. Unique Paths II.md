# 63. Unique Paths II



## Problem Description



A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```



## Solution

```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=63 lang=python3
#
# [63] Unique Paths II
#
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        height = len(obstacleGrid)
        width = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        paths = [(width+1)*[0] for _ in range(height+1)]
        paths[-2][-1] = 1
        for n in range(height-1,-1,-1):
            for m in range(width-1,-1,-1):
                paths[n][m] = 0 if obstacleGrid[n][m] else paths[n+1][m]+paths[n][m+1]
        
        return paths[0][0]

```



## Tips

- 开始时还停留在上一题的思维中试图用组合数
  - 然后发现并不简单
- 重新开始思考，可以用递归
- 然后自然想到**动态规划**
  - **在外面包一层 0**
