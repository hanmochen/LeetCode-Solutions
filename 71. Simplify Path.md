# 71. Simplify Path



## Problem Description



Given an **absolute path** for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the **canonical path**.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period `.` refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period `..` moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: [Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix](https://www.linuxnix.com/abslute-path-vs-relative-path-in-linuxunix/)

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `/`, and there must be only a single slash `/` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) **must not** end with a trailing `/`. Also, the canonical path must be the **shortest** string representing the absolute path.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
```

**Example 6:**

```
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
```





## Solution



```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=71 lang=python3
#
# [71] Simplify Path
#
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        result = []
        for dire in path.split('/'):
            if dire and dire != '.' : 
                if dire == '..' : 
                    if result: result.pop()
                else: result.append(dire)
        return '/'+'/'.join(result)
                
        
```





## Tips

- 首先按 `/` 分开
- 如果两个 `/` 之间为 ` ` 或者 `.` 则不动
- 如果为`..` 则往上一级（`pop`），注意根目录的情况
- 其余的加入
