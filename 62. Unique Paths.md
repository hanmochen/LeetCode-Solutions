# 62. Unique Paths

## Problem Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```



## Solution

```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=62 lang=python3
#
# [62] Unique Paths
#
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        def combinationNumber(n,m):
            m = m if m<n-m else n-m
            if m == 0: return 1
            up,down,ans = n,1,1
            while(m>0):
                ans = (ans*up)//down
                up -= 1
                down += 1
                m -= 1
            return ans
        
        return combinationNumber(m+n-2,m-1)
```



## Tips

- return $\binom{n-1}{n-1+m-1}$
  - It needs `m+n-2` steps to get there, `n-1` down, `m-1` left.
  - Choose `n-1` from `n+m-2`
- Calculate the combination numbers
  - `m = min(m,n-m)` is the key
