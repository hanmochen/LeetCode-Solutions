# 75. Sort Colors



## Problem Description 



Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solution 



```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=75 lang=python3
#
# [75] Sort Colors
#
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums:[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        zeros,ones=-1,-1
        for index,num in enumerate(nums):
            nums[index] = 2
            if num == 0:
                zeros += 1
                ones += 1
                nums[ones] = 1
                nums[zeros] = 0
            elif num == 1:
                ones += 1
                nums[ones] = 1
        
        return


```



## Tips



- 只遍历一遍的话：
  - 记录 0，1 结束的位置和当前位置
  - 替换
