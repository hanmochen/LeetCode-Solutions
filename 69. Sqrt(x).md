# 69. Sqrt(x)



## Problem Description



Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```



## Solution



```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=69 lang=python3
#
# [69] Sqrt(x)
#
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        
        xn = x
        while(xn*xn>x):
            xn = (xn+x/xn)//2
        return(int(xn))
```



## Tips



基本的平方根算法

$x_{n+1} = \frac 1 2 (x_n + \frac a {x_n})$
