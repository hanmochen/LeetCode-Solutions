# 64. Minimum Path Sum



## Problem Description



Given a *m* x *n* grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which *minimizes* the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```



## Solution



```python
#
# @lc app=leetcode id=64 lang=python3
#
# [64] Minimum Path Sum
#
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int: 
        height = len(grid)
        width = len(grid[0])
        paths = [(width+1)*[float('inf')] for _ in range(height+1)]
        paths[-2][-1]=0
        for n in range(height-1,-1,-1):
            for m in range(width-1,-1,-1):
                paths[n][m] = grid[n][m] + min(paths[n+1][m],paths[n][m+1])
        
        return paths[0][0]
```
