# 55. Jump Game



## Problem Description



Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```



## Solution



```python

# @lc app=leetcode id=55 lang=python3
#
# [55] Jump Game
#
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

        currentPosition = 0
        while(currentPosition < len(nums)-1):        
            oneStepRange = currentPosition +nums[currentPosition] # one step max range
            if oneStepRange >= len(nums)-1: return True # Only needs one more step
            nextPosition = oneStepRange 
            twoStepRange = oneStepRange+nums[oneStepRange]
            for i in range(currentPosition+1,oneStepRange+1):
                if i+nums[i]>twoStepRange:
                    twoStepRange = i+nums[i]
                    nextPosition = i
            if nums[nextPosition] == 0: return False
            currentPosition = nextPosition
        
        return True

- 思路与 [Jump Game II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/) 类似
- **看两步**
- 如果两步走的最远的下一步也只能走 0，说明前进不了
